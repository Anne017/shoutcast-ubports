## shoutcast-ubports

A Shoutcast player for UBPorts. This project is for me to see how 'portable' QML is and how hard/easy it is to create an app for UBPorts.

I develop it for use on my Moto G 2014 (titan).

If ever finished it at all it will be a simple app that only allows to:
  * Browse by Genre
  * List Top 500
  * Search by 'Now Playing' or Keywords
  * Play/Pause
  
### Thanks

  * mimecar for his VirtualBox VM with the Ubuntu SDK
