"<p>This app allows to browse the <b>SHOUTcast</b> database and tune in on "

"   <li>Search by 'Now Playing' or Keywords</li>\n"

" </ul>\n"
" <p>The player area at the bottom allows to pause/play a stream en by "
"horizontal swiping\n"
" to navigate the stations list (next/previous).</p>\n"
" <p>Main Issues:</p>\n"

"   <li>If there is no network then you are toast</li>\n"
"   <li>The stations lists can show the logos (see the Settings page) but it "
"makes the app crash a lot.</li>\n"
"   <li>The app checks if the Audio object has meta data available like "
"current track info but appearently\n"
"       this is not implemented in UBPorts. See https://bugs.launchpad.net/"
